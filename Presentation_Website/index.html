            <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
    
            <p>Smile is a static Android-based marketplace app tailored exclusively for the University of Manitoba community, including students, faculty, and staff. It provides a safe and trusted platform for buying, selling, exchanging, or donating university-related items such as textbooks, electronics, notes, and daily essentials.</p>
    
            <p>The application aims to simplify campus life while creating an atmosphere of trust, belonging, and collaboration. Smile encourages members to connect meaningfully by enabling them to exchange both paid and free resources conveniently.</p>
    
            <h3>Core Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>📚 Marketplace for buying and selling.</li>
                <li>🎁 Free Items section that promotes generosity among peers.</li>
                <li>🔍 Lost & Found system to help recover misplaced personal belongings like ID cards and wallets.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Smile also fosters a more sustainable campus by reducing waste through the reuse of goods and lowering dependency on new purchases. Its intuitive design ensures that users can easily list and search for items through categorized listings.</p>
    
            <h3>Trust & Safety:</h3>
            <p>To guarantee trust and safety, Smile enforces university verification — allowing only users with @myumanitoba.ca or @umanitoba.ca email addresses to register.</p>
    
            <h3>Success Criteria:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>✔ Achieve active usage from at least 50% of the University of Manitoba's active community, engaging weekly via buying, selling, giving away, or using the Lost & Found section.</li>
                <li>✔ Foster high user satisfaction, leading to positive word-of-mouth within the university.</li>
                <li>✔ Contribute to the university's environmental goals by reducing waste through item reuse.</li>
                <li>✔ Establish a reputation for safe and secure transactions among verified university members.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p><strong>Ultimately, Smile is more than just a marketplace — it is a step toward building a more affordable, supportive, and eco-friendly campus for all.</strong></p>

        <div class="postmortem-block">
            <h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
            <p>The architecture of Smile was broadly similar to the demo system, following a layered structure. However, we did not strictly enforce separation of concerns. While our intention was to clearly separate the UI, logic, and data layers, some components ended up violating this structure.</p>
            <p>In particular, certain logic classes became coupled with Android-specific components. This design decision led to challenges during iteration 3, as it made the system harder to refactor and maintain.</p>
        </div>
    
        <!-- Block 2 -->
        <div class="postmortem-block">
            <h3>What Went Right?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Successfully implemented the login system with university email verification.</li>
                <li>✅ Core functionalities like item listing, bookmarking, filtering, sorting, and lost & found were built organically without major blockers.</li>
                <li>✅ The team collaborated well, leading to the development of an intuitive user interface.</li>
                <li>✅ Team communication and task coordination were effective, especially during the early phases.</li>
                <li>✅ Internal testing confirmed that most features performed as expected and aligned with user needs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <!-- Block 3 -->
        <div class="postmortem-block">
            <h3>What Went Wrong?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>⚠️ Accumulation of technical debt due to lack of architectural focus in the early stages.</li>
                <li>⚠️ The project suffered from high coupling and did not fully comply with SOLID principles.</li>
                <li>⚠️ Much of iteration 3 was consumed by refactoring and restructuring, instead of focusing on extending features.</li>
                <li>⚠️ Time constraints limited our ability to restore the previously working model fully.</li>
                <li>⚠️ The planned FAQ section remained incomplete due to the lack of time and resources.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <!-- Block 4 -->
        <div class="postmortem-block">
            <h3>Changes from the Initial Vision</h3>
            <p>While Smile initially started as a basic marketplace focused solely on buying and selling, we gradually expanded its scope by adding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🎁 Free Items Section</li>
                <li>🆘 Lost & Found Section</li>
                <li>⭐ Bookmarking functionality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This expansion enhanced the app’s usefulness but also increased its complexity. While the core idea was successfully maintained, time constraints and technical debt impacted our ability to fully polish the final product.</p>
